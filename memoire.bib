	abstract = {Tensor network methods are taking a central role in modern quantum physics and beyond. They can provide an efficient approximation to certain classes of quantum states, and the associated graphical language makes it easy to describe and pictorially reason about quantum circuits, channels, protocols, open systems and more. Our goal is to explain tensor networks and some associated methods as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states. We conclude the tutorial with tensor contractions evaluating combinatorial counting problems. The first one counts the number of solutions for Boolean formulae, whereas the second is Penrose's tensor contraction algorithm, returning the number of \$3\$-edge-colorings of \$3\$-regular planar graphs.},

The book has 7 parts and over 40 subsections which took shape in over a decade of teaching. In addition to covering the foundations, the book covers important applications such as matrix product states, open quantum systems and entanglement \$-\$ all cast into the diagrammatic tensor network language. The intended audience includes those in quantum information science wishing to learn about tensor networks. It includes scientists who have employed tensor networks in their modeling codes who have interest in the tools graphical reasoning capacity. The audience further includes the graduate student researcher, whom with some effort, should find this book accessible. I would appreciate it if you emailed me about any mistakes or typos you find.},

	abstract = {Many problems such as node classication and link prediction in network data can be solved using graph embeddings. However, it is dicult to use graphs to capture non-binary relations such as communities of nodes. These kinds of complex relations are expressed more naturally as hypergraphs. While hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs, state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques are not adequate for solving prediction and classication tasks on large hypergraphs accurately in reasonable time. In this paper, we introduce HyperNetVec, a novel hierarchical framework for scalable unsupervised hypergraph embedding. HyperNetVec exploits shared-memory parallelism and is capable of generating high quality embeddings for real-world hypergraphs with millions of nodes and hyperedges in only a couple of minutes while existing hypergraph systems either fail for such large hypergraphs or may take days to produce the embeddings.},

This framework allows us to enforce stabilizer commutation, \$X/Z\$ balancing, finite rate, sparsity, and maximum-degree constraints simultaneously in a CSP that we can then solve numerically. Using a state-of-the-art CSP solver, we obtain convincing evidence for the existence of a satisfiability threshold. Furthermore, the extent of the satisfiable phase increases with the number of qubits. In that phase, finding sparse codes becomes an easy problem. Moreover, we observe that the sparse codes found in the satisfiable phase practically achieve the channel capacity for erasure noise. Our results show that intermediate-size finite-rate sparse quantum codes are easy to find, while also demonstrating a flexible methodology for generating good codes with custom properties. We therefore establish a complete and customizable pipeline for random quantum code discovery.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

    abstract = {High-performance Ising machines for solving combinatorial optimization problems have been developed with digital processors implementing heuristic algorithms such as simulated bifurcation (SB). Although Ising machines have been designed for second-order cost functions, there are practical problems expressed naturally by higher-order cost functions. In this work, we extend SB to such higher-order cost functions. By solving a problem having third-order cost functions, we show that the higher-order SB can outperform not only the second-order SB with additional spin variables, but also simulated annealing applied directly to the third-order cost functions. This result suggests that the higher-order SB can be practically useful.}

The phase diagram is investigated and paramagnetic (P), ferromagnetic (F), spin glass (SG) and mixed (M) phases, meeting at a multicritical point (p*,T*), are identified. The P/F and P/SG phase boundaries are derived, and the F/M and M/SG boundaries are calculated close to (p*,T*). The condition for having a re-entrant spin-glass transition is derived. In non-zero magnetic field a p-dependent A-T instability line is obtained. The authors apply their results to the insulator EuxSr1-xS, it is predicted to exhibit re-entrant behaviour.}

  abstract = {A new theory of the class of dilute magnetic alloys, called the spin glasses, is proposed which offers a simple explanation of the cusp found experimentally in the susceptibility. The argument is that because the interaction between the spins dissolved in the matrix oscillates in sign according to distance, there will be no mean ferro- or antiferromagnetism, but there will be a ground state with the spins aligned in definite directions, even if these directions appear to be at random. At the critical temperature the existence of these preferred directions affects the orientation of the spins, leading to a cusp in the susceptibility. This cusp is smoothed by an external field. Although the behaviour at low t needs a quantum mechanical treatment, it is interesting to complete the classical calculations down to t=0. Classically the susceptibility tends to a constant value at t=0, and the specific heat to a constant value.}

  abstract = 	 { Tensor networks are a powerful modeling framework developed for computational many-body physics, which have only recently been applied within machine learning. In this work we utilize a uniform matrix product state (u-MPS) model for probabilistic modeling of sequence data. We first show that u-MPS enable sequence-level parallelism, with length-n sequences able to be evaluated in depth O(log n). We then introduce a novel generative algorithm giving trained u-MPS the ability to efficiently sample from a wide variety of conditional distributions, each one defined by a regular expression. Special cases of this algorithm correspond to autoregressive and fill-in-the-blank sampling, but more complex regular expressions permit the generation of richly structured data in a manner that has no direct analogue in neural generative models. Experiments on sequence modeling with synthetic and real text data show u-MPS outperforming a variety of baselines and effectively generalizing their predictions in the presence of limited data. }

	abstract = {The mathematical problem of approximating one matrix by another of lower rank is closely related to the fundamental postulate of factor-theory. When formulated as a least-squares problem, the normal equations cannot be immediately written down, since the elements of the approximate matrix are not independent of one another. The solution of the problem is simplified by first expressing the matrices in a canonic form. It is found that the problem always has a solution which is usually unique. Several conclusions can be drawn from the form of this solution.},

	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

Our result can be extended to the physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two-dimensional grid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models allows stating the main open problems in quantum computation using well-studied mathematical objects such as eigenvectors and spectral gaps of sparse matrices.},

	abstract = {We introduce a distributed classical simulation algorithm for general quantum circuits, and present numerical results for calculating the output probabilities of universal random circuits. We find that we can simulate more qubits to greater depth than previously reported using the cluster supported by the Data Infrastructure and Search Technology Division of the Alibaba Group. For example, computing a single amplitude of an \$8{\textbackslash}times 8\$ qubit circuit with depth \$40\$ was previously beyond the reach of supercomputers. Our algorithm can compute this within \$2\$ minutes using a small portion (\${\textbackslash}approx\$ 14\% of the nodes) of the cluster. Furthermore, by successfully simulating quantum supremacy circuits of size \$9{\textbackslash}times 9{\textbackslash}times 40\$, \$10{\textbackslash}times 10{\textbackslash}times 35 \$, \$11{\textbackslash}times 11{\textbackslash}times 31\$, and \$12{\textbackslash}times 12{\textbackslash}times 27 \$, we give evidence that noisy random circuits with realistic physical parameters may be simulated classically. This suggests that either harder circuits or error-correction may be vital for achieving quantum supremacy from random circuit sampling.},
